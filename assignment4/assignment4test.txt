Selected "Comet" in venue dropdown
Returned 5 shows
Selected "Jazz Alley" in venue dropdown
Returned the same 5 shows
Tested the service
Same result
(So at least not a problem with the client)
Artist dropdown results are similarly identical-looking
"All Shows!" button returns a list of "Item"s
Web Client mirrors service's results
So... the web client is a success?
